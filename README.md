# Keypress Sound

## Objective

This was a tiny project to replicate the functionality of keypress sounds in Google Keyboard on Android Devices and an in-built feature in iPhones.

Built simply for fun.

## How to run

Clone the repository via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maaz25925/keypress-sound-py.git
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements. txt
```

Run `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

And you are off ðŸš€!

## Future TODOs

1. Add custom sound picker.
1. Add something instead of the blank screen.
